With an understanding of what is in play, managers can adopt solutions that best address their business needs while advancing government-wide architecture.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Directive on Management of Information Technology](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249), provides guidance on how to assess Enterprise Architecture through Appendix C - Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment."
